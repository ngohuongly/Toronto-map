# Week-3-project-
This project is about the how I obtained the data of the postcal codes in Canada on Wikipedia and how i transformed the data into a pandas dataframe. 
I did not use BeautifulSoup but the dataframe that I got is fine. I also tried to add the longitude and the lattitude using the csv file that I got and I added more columns to the dataframe that I created.
